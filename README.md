**NVIDIA DCF Valuation Project**

This repository contains a valuation of NVIDIA Corporation using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The goal of this project was to estimate the intrinsic value of NVIDIA based on projected future cash flows and compare that value to the company’s current market price.

**Features**

The Excel model in this project includes:

- Historical financial statements
- Projections for revenue, operating expenses, and net income
- A three-statement model (income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement)
- Free Cash Flow (FCF) calculations
- A Discounted Cash Flow valuation using an estimated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

**How It Works**

1. Analyzed NVIDIA’s historical financial performance to establish assumptions for future growth and margins.
2. Built projected financial statements based on those assumptions.
3. Calculated future Free Cash Flows.
4. Discounted those cash flows to the present using WACC to estimate intrinsic value.
5. Compared the intrinsic value to NVIDIA’s current market valuation.

**Reason for Selecting NVIDIA**

NVIDIA is a major company in the semiconductor and AI industry. Its rapid growth and significant market attention make it a relevant example for applying the DCF approach and evaluating whether current pricing reflects fundamental performance.

**Insights Gained**

This project demonstrates how a DCF model can be used to estimate a company’s intrinsic value. The valuation results depend heavily on assumptions such as revenue growth, cost structure, and discount rates. Small changes to these inputs can materially impact the intrinsic value, so the final number should be interpreted as a range rather than a precise figure.
